## Project Description

**Chefmate AI** is a full-stack AI-driven cooking assistant designed to answer fundamental questions like:

> _‚ÄúWhat can I cook with what I have right now?‚Äù_

This project reimagines how users interact with recipe databases by transforming traditional keyword searches into a **context-aware, conversational recommendation system**. The frontend features a seamless chat-based user interface that allows users to input their prompts, while the backend executes a highly modular natural language processing (NLP) pipeline powered by local inference and vector-based retrieval (RAG).

Chefmate AI goes beyond static recipes; it understands ingredient substitutions, cooking methods, and dietary constraints through an **LLM-enhanced recipe reasoning engine** enhanced using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This enables the system to generate custom cooking instructions and recommendations in real-time, fostering an interactive dialogue that adapts to user needs and preferences.

By combining advanced AI techniques with a user-friendly interface, Chefmate AI provides a dynamic cooking experience that empowers users to explore their culinary creativity and make the most of their available ingredients.

## Features

### üß† Conversational Recipe Retrieval
- Accepts natural-language queries (e.g., _‚ÄúWhat can I make with mushrooms and garlic?‚Äù_)
- Retrieves relevant recipes using semantic understanding, not keyword matching
- Maintains conversational context over multiple turns

### üîç Ingredient-Based Search with Substitution
- Analyzes available ingredients and dietary preferences
- Suggests recipes based on pantry inventory

### üí¨ Real-Time Local LLM Inference
- Uses Mistral 7B in GGUF format for local, high-performance inference
- Entire inference stack runs offline ‚Äî no internet required
- Ensures fast, private, and secure conversational flow

### üìö Vector-Based Semantic Search
- Embeds both queries and recipes using MiniLM transformers

- Smart fallback logic ensures query satisfaction

### üõ†Ô∏è Modular NLP Pipeline
- Heuristic intent detection categorizes user messages (e.g., find, refine, clarify)
- Dynamic prompt construction using system template + retrieved context + chat history
- Output is sanitized and structured in standard JSON

### üßæ Structured Recipe Output
- JSON format includes: title, ingredient list, method, and optional tips
- Cleanly parsed responses ideal for rendering in frontend

## Configuration

Follow the instructions below to set up the configuration files.:

### Backend

Located at: `backend/config.yml`

This file defines the paths to your data, model, and index files, as well as the settings for embedding generation.

```yaml
paths:
  recipe_data: "data/raw/recipes.csv"                     # Raw recipe dataset from Kaggle
  cleaned_data_csv: "data/processed/cleaned_recipes.csv"  # Cleaned CSV after preprocessing
  cleaned_data_pkl: "data/processed/cleaned_recipes.pkl"  # Serialized data for fast loading
  faiss_index_dir: "data/indexes"                         # Directory containing FAISS indexes
  model_path: "models/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf"  # Path to the downloaded GGUF model

embedding:
  model_name: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"    # Sentence-transformers model used for recipe embeddings
  batch_size: 128                   # Batch size for embedding generation
```

### Frontend

Located at: `frontend/.env`

This file contains the base API URL used by the React frontend to communicate with the FastAPI backend.

```env
VITE_API_URL='http://localhost:8000'
```

## Testing

To ensure Chefmate AI is working correctly, follow these steps for basic backend and frontend validation.

### Backend Testing

- Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

- Try endpoint: `/chat`

- Test a basic ingredients POST request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw '{"chat_history":[{"role":"user","content":"What can I cook with flour, eggs, salt, onion and garlic"}]}'
    ```

### Frontend Testing

- Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- Access the app at:
    ```bash 
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

- Enter a few ingredients or recipe suggestions.

- Check the browser console and network tab for API activity.

- Verify error messages and UI responsiveness.

## FAQs

**Q: Where can I get the recipe dataset?**  
**A:** The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. Search for "Food Recipes Dataset" on Kaggle, download the CSV file, and place it at the path defined in `config.yml`, usually `data/raw/recipes.csv`.

--

**Q: The backend is not starting because of a missing model file. What should I do?**  
**A:** You must manually download the mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf model file from Hugging Face:
[https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF)

Save the file to the `backend/models/` directory. Make sure the path in your `config.yml` is correctly set to point to this file.

--

**Q: The frontend loads, but nothing is displayed. What‚Äôs wrong?**  
**A:** Check the following:

- Make sure the backend is running at `http://localhost:8000`

- Verify that the `.env` file in the frontend directory includes the correct API URL (e.g., VITE_API_URL='http://localhost:8000')

- Ensure the recipe data has been properly cleaned and indexed. Files should exist in `data/processed/` and `data/indexes/`.

--

**Q:How is recipe data processed and indexed?**  
**A:** 
- Raw recipe data is cleaned and stored in `data/processed/`.

- Embeddings are generated and stored in the same folder.

- FAISS indexes for title, ingredient, and ingredient_with_quantity are saved in `data/indexes/`.

You can update the configuration paths for these in `config.yml`.

Refer to the Installation and Configuration sections above for detailed setup.
